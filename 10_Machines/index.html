  For this class, I decided to go with something simple for my project. Using stepper motors proved to be a bit complicated 
  but I think I was able to manage. I decided to make a simple spinning basketball hoop. First thing I did for this lab time was I wired up the stepper motor to the DRV component and then to my 
  Arduino board. I used the DRV8834 module with a 100uf capacitor to build the circut. Here was the finished product of the initial wiring.

  After this I ran some initial code to see if the motor would work. Unfortunatley, my 6 year old MacBook Air did not contain the power 
  to turn a motor like this and gave me an error message when I plugged the circut in. At this point, whenever I plugged the circut in, my MacBook would 
  cut the power to the USB ports so the circut wouldn't drain my computer.

  Though I was getting this error, the motor still seemed to be getting a small amount of power. Whenever I ran my code, the motor shaft would 
  lock up so that it was much harder to turn with my hand which told me that the motor was reciving some sort of power even if it was only the small amount 
  that my computer could handle. I tried to capture this in a video and I'm not sure how effective a video is going to be in demonstrating this but 
  here it is anyway.

  Next part is fabicating the small hoop I made. First thing I did was I designed two very simple shaped in Fusion 360. 
  I made a simple rectangle for the backboard and a small circle with a cutout to make the rim. I took the files to the laser printer 
  and did a very short cut. Next thing I did was I cut a small square post of wood for the support. I glued the rim to the backboard 
  then the backboard to the post to complete the hoop. I then used a drill to create a hole in the bottom of the post that would fit perfectly 
  over the shaft of the stepper motor.
