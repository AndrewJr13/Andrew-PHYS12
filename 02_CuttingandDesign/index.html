  ### Class 2: Cutting and Design 

   For Week 2 I decided to make a simple bridge for my project. With no prior knowledge of 
   Fusion 360, it was intimidating at first but I was able to effectivley grow and learn.
   I decided that my bridge would be held together by connecting railings and would be supported
   by 2 cross shaped pieces. The bridge itself wouldn't be too long to save materials but I decided
   it would not be a miniscule model either. So I got to Fusion. These were my first designs.
   As you see in the pictures, the shapes on the left would combind to make one cross shaped peice
    and the shape on the left would be the actual bridge to walk on. Then the third picture is both
    parts extruded.
