  <head>Class 2: Cutting and Design</head>
  


  For Week 2 I decided to make a simple bridge for my project. With no prior knowledge of 
  Fusion 360, it was intimidating at first but I was able to effectivley grow and learn.
  I decided that my bridge would be held together by connecting railings and would be supported
  by 2 cross shaped pieces. The bridge itself wouldn't be too long to save materials but I decided
  it would not be a miniscule model either. So I got to Fusion. These were my first designs. Making lines and rectangles
  was a bit to get used to but the user parameters turned out to be very helpful in this process. Overall,
  these first shapes did not take me too long. I also found it fun to see the shapes extruded and be able to apply
  rounded edges to ensure that the cardboard would fit together well enough. Really the only thing semi difficult about 
  using Fusion, was making sure I was sizing everything correctly. I did not want to use too much material, but at the same 
  time, if my model was too small, some pieces would be to fragile and would most likley not fit, together. 
  Even though this proved to be a struggle for some time, I was able to make an estimate and got near 
  perfect results the first time cutting. As you see in the pictures, the shapes on the left would combind to make one cross shaped piece
  and the shape on the left would be the actual bridge to walk on. Then the third picture is both extruded 
  and set to the thickness of the cardboard.

  Next I was able to use the laser cutter to just print out these to see how they would fit and measure the kerf
  on specific pieces. I found that account for kerf=0.29 was the perfect setting to have the pieces fit 
  together. After cutting the pieces with the correct kerf, the support system looked to be a sucess. Using the laser cutter itself
  was also a very rewarding experience. It was relativley easy to use with just a quick but effective lesson from Suvin. It made precise cuts 
  and my cardboard ended up fitting together very nicley. As I mentioned earlier, the sizings came
  out very well. I used a measure of 120mm for one piece of the bridge meaning that put together, 
  the bridge would total 240mm which is roughly 9.4 inches. The height of the bridge stood at 
  around 70mm which is about 2.75 inches. The cross shapes I mentioned before
  would have a lip that would fit right into a slot cut out on the actual bridge part.
  So this mean't that I had to get the kerf right because if I didn't, the bridge would have to support to hold it up. There was  After the pieces were cut, I was able to assemble part of the bridge.
  Below are some pictures of the cut out parts and how they fit together:

  Finally, one of the most crucial parts of the building of this bridge, the rails. I designed
  the bridge so that the rails would hold the two actual bridge parts together. The first shorter section of 
  rails on the bridge started off as just a rectangle but then I thought that I would make it a bit more intresting 
  and try to round the edge of the rectangle to make the bridge look fancier. I will show this in the 
  pictures. Still, the long part of the rail was just a rectangle that connected to this shorter section or rails. 
  the long rail would bury into a slot on the first bridge piece then another one on the second bridge
  piece. This means that this one long piece would be able to hold both parts together. Each rail had a small lip that would 
  fit into a slot on either of the bridge pieces. By this time, all that was left to do was make some more copies
  to ensure that both sides of the bridge had the correct amount of peices. I went one last time to the laser and cut out these 
  final copies and started to assemble my bridge. But I ran into a roadblock. You might be able to see that in these 
  pictures, on side has shorter starting rails than the other. It turns out that I blanked when doing 
  the calculations for the offsets for the insetrions for these rails. But, a quick run back to Fusion to fix
  my rail length, and this issue was solved. It is a very hard differnece to notice but I just wanted to document 
  that one problem that I had during this assignment. So without further ado, here are the final sketches, pieces and the 
  final assembled bridge, and aditionally, I have also included my models of some household items. I chose a simple pencil
  and a dice that one of my roomates had:
