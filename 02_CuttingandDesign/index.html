  ### Class 2: Cutting and Design 

  For Week 2 I decided to make a simple bridge for my project. With no prior knowledge of 
  Fusion 360, it was intimidating at first but I was able to effectivley grow and learn.
  I decided that my bridge would be held together by connecting railings and would be supported
  by 2 cross shaped pieces. The bridge itself wouldn't be too long to save materials but I decided
  it would not be a miniscule model either. So I got to Fusion. These were my first designs. Making lines and rectangles
  was a bit to get used to but the user parameters turned out to be very helpful in this process. Overall,
  these first shapes did not take me too long. I also found it fun to see the shapes extruded and be able to apply
  rounded edges to ensure that the cardboard would fit together well enough. Really the only thing semi difficult about 
  using Fusion, was making sure I was sizing everything correctly. I did not want to use too much material, but at the same 
  time, if my model was too small, some peices would be to fragile and would most likley not fit, together. 
  Even though this proved to be a struggle for some time, I was able to make an estimate and got near 
  perfect results the first time cutting. As you see in the pictures, the shapes on the left would combind to make one cross shaped piece
  and the shape on the left would be the actual bridge to walk on. Then the third picture is both extruded 
  and set to the thickness of the cardboard.

  Next I was able to use the laser cutter to just print out these to see how they would fit and measure the kerf
  on specific pieces. I found that account for kerf=0.3 was the perfect setting to have the pieces fit 
  together. After cutting the pieces with the correct kerf, the support system looked to be a sucess. Using the laser cutter itself
  was also a very rewarding experience. It was relativley easy to use with just a quick but effective lesson from Suvin. It made precise cuts 
  and my cardboard ended up fitting together very nicley. As I mentioned earlier, the sizings came
  out very well. I used a measure of 120mm for one piece of the bridge meaning that put together, 
  the bridge would total 240mm which is roughly 9.4 inches. The height of the bridge stood at 
  around 70mm which is about 2.75 inches. After the pieces were cut, I was able to assemble part of the bridge.
  Below are some pictures of the cut out parts and how they fit together:
