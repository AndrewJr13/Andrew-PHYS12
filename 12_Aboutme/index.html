  Hello my name is Andrew Melton. I am 17 years old and live in Franklin, MA. I am going
  to be a senior in highschool and plan to major in mechanical engineering in college. My interests
  relating to this class include coding, engineering, and building. My interests outside of this 
  class include basketball, baseball, cars, and music. I play travel basketball, played on my 
  highschool's baseball team, and play the piano, saxophone, and drums. In this course I wanted
  to make an innovative final project that would display the skills that I will learn through the course. Through my time as 
  a highschool student, I have learned many essential skills that I intend to use in the course but I 
  think, through this program I hope to build my skills in problem solving, innovation, and communication. 
  I hope to be a very sucessful engineer one day and this class will allow me to build my foundation
  even more through the skills of fabrication. I also hope to make many friends in the process
