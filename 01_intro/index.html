  ### Class 1: Introduction and Project Proposal 
  ![](./sketches.png) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ![](./door3.png)

  My Proposal: Automated Door Locker. Around the world, hundreds of thousands of break 
  ins happen wheather it's into a car, house, shed, etc. People's property gets stolen and 
  thousands of dollars of valuables disappear with no hope of them returning. What's a main 
  reason for this? Locks. Wheather it's people forgetting to lock their dooe, a malfunctioning
  lock, or people just being lazy in general, the main cause of these break ins are failure to lock 
  the area. My proposal for the automated door locker is one that sloves those things. You will never forget 
  to lock your door as you wont ever have to remember to lock your door. The automated door locker uses a 
  small plastic key that will send out a signal when the holder reaches a certain distance from the door. 
  The key will then tell the door to lock. Nothing needs to be pressed on the key. The user just needs to 
  attach it to their keychain and can forget about their worries of locking their doors. As for the locking 
  itself, I was thinking of using either a conventional locking system or two sliders that block both sides of the 
  door. Either way, the entire system will contain a square frame with a rectangular door. The locking system
  will most likley be embeded inside the frame and will push a blocker inside of the door. This project would be a start
  to some mechanical engineering principles and would also be a solution to less break ins inside of 
  homes an cars.
