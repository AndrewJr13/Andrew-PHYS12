  <head>Class 6: Eletronic Input Devices</head> 

  This week we studied Electronic Input Devices such as accelerometers, microphones, and thermistors. We also studied
  capacitance and made sensors with capacitors. For my sensor built using capacitors, I decided to build a 
  flex sensor to measur the amount of force an object would have on the sensor based on its weight. How the sensor works 
  is two pieces of copper stuck to pieces of velostat. As the pieces were compressed,they got closer together
  giving higher readings on the serial monitor. A quick few lines of code to get the readikng from the pieces and 
  give an ouput were necessary but it was generally an easy make. I tested various weights on top of the flex. Here's how the sensor turned out.
