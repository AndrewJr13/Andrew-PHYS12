  <head>Class 6: Eletronic Input Devices</head> 

  This week we studied Electronic Input Devices such as accelerometers, microphones, and thermistors. We also studied
  capacitance and made sensors with capacitors. For my sensor built using capacitors, I decided to build a 
  flex sensor to measur the amount of force an object would have on the sensor based on its weight. How the sensor works 
  is two pieces of copper stuck to pieces of velostat. As the pieces were compressed,they got closer together
  giving higher readings on the serial monitor. A quick few lines of code to get the readikng from the pieces and 
  give an ouput were necessary but it was generally an easy make.

  I then used a scale in the lab to weigh various objects. I took down their weight in grams, converted their weight 
  into newtons to measure force then recorded the output. I tested my phone, a piece of metal, and a drill.

  And here is the code I used for the sensor.

  <pre><code class="language-arduino">
    int analog_pin = A3;
  int tx_pin = 4;
  int read_high;
  int read_low;
  int diff; 

void setup() {
    pinMode(tx_pin, OUTPUT);      
    Serial.begin(9600);
}

void loop() {
    digitalWrite(tx_pin,HIGH);           
    read_high = analogRead(analog_pin);  
    delayMicroseconds(100);              
    digitalWrite(tx_pin,LOW);            
    read_low = analogRead(analog_pin);   
    diff = read_high - read_low;         
    Serial.println(diff);
}
  </code></pre>

  So that was the first sensor I built. For my self made sensor, I started out wanting to do something with
  the phototransitor. Soon, I moved on to testing things out like the accelerometer and the micorphone and 
  I took a liking to the mircophone. First, I had to solder the pin attachment onto the actual microphone 
  so it would fit into my breadboard. After this, the microphone didn't take many connections to hook up. I used A0
  as my DC pin and connected the power and the ground. To calibrate this sensor, I went into my dorm and made sure it was silent.
  I used a decibel meter on my phone to measure how loud things like a finger snap or dropping something was. I then recorded 
  the noise level in dB then recorded the output that te program gave me. The application I used on my phone is called Decibel X. 
  I will leave a link to it at the bottom.

  Finally, I have two programs that I ran the microphone through. The first program would just give an output 
  for me to record on the table based on the noise level but I then wrote another one to turn the microphone into a 
  little noise detector. The code was pretty basic. Whenever the microphone would get a reading higher than 5 or 10,
  it will print out "Noise Detected" in the serial monitor. One thing I also noticed was that the microphone also 
  has pretty good range. Obviously, the closer the sound the higher the reading but even standing 10-15 feet away from 
  the microphone still gave readings.

  First Program:

  <pre><code class="language-arduino">
    const int sampleWindow = 50; 
 unsigned int sample;

 void setup() 
 {
    Serial.begin(9600);
 }


 void loop() 
 {
    unsigned long startMillis= millis();  
    unsigned int peakToPeak = 0;   

    unsigned int signalMax = 0;
    unsigned int signalMin = 1024;

    // collect data for 50 mS
    while (millis() - startMillis < sampleWindow)
    {
       sample = analogRead(0);   
       if (sample < 1024)  
       {
          if (sample > signalMax)
          {
             signalMax = sample;  
          }
          else if (sample < signalMin)
          {
             signalMin = sample;  
          }
       }
    }
    peakToPeak = signalMax - signalMin;  

    Serial.println(peakToPeak);
 }
</code></pre>
  <br>
  <br>
  Here's what I changed in the first program to make the noise detector. I just added a very simple if statement and a new print statement. 
  
  <pre><code class="language-arduino">
    if (peakToPeak > 10)
    {
      Serial.println("Noise Detected");
    }
  </code></pre>
