  <head>Class 7: Electronic Output Devices</head>
  
  For Class 7 our assignment was to merge what we learned last week about input devices with
  an output device. Last week I experimented with a microphone so I decided to expand a little on that. My initial
  ideas was to create an alarm system tha would be activated by a loud noise. I decided to get some initial wiring down
  and then try to write a program. Most of the wiring in this project was relativley easy. Most of it was just hooking up the 
  devices individualy. For the buzzer, I cut some wires and soldered them to the pins and used another very small wire 
  for a short connetion on the board.

  As I said, the connections were generally simple. I hooked the microphone up to power and hooked the buzzer 
  up to an assigned pin. Next I started off trying to integrate a simple program. I started off with a program 
  that would take readings from the noise level the microphone was reciving. I put this in the void loop method. 
  Next I decided that the alarm would go off for noises above 10 units on the serial monitor. Taking my previous code, 
  I embeded an if statement that would read the serial monitor reading and decide if it was loud enough. If it was, I started off with 
  a simple buzzer tone using Arduino's tone library. Later on in my lab session, I wrote a new method for my tone and called it 
  pitchTone. pitchTone takes in 3 integer parameters and creates a specific tone based on those inputs. The code also included the use of a method 
  I though was really interesting called millis. I learned that millis would return the current time passed since the actual board was plugged into the computer which
  I thout was a really neat litte method which I will most likley use in the future. I used a for loop to run the tone for a longer period of time as well. Here's my code.  
  
  <pre><code class="language-arduino">
  const int sampleWindow = 50; 
  int buzzerPin = 10;
  unsigned int sample;

 void setup() 
 {
    Serial.begin(9600);
    pinMode(buzzerPin, OUTPUT);
 }

 
 void loop() 
 {
    unsigned long startMillis= millis();  
    unsigned int peakToPeak = 0;   

    unsigned int signalMax = 0;
    unsigned int signalMin = 1024;

    
    while (millis() - startMillis < sampleWindow)
    {
       sample = analogRead(0);   
       if (sample < 1024)  
       {
          if (sample > signalMax)
          {
             signalMax = sample;  
          }
          else if (sample < signalMin)
          {
             signalMin = sample;  
          }
       }
    }
    peakToPeak = signalMax - signalMin;  

   
    if (peakToPeak > 10)
    {
      Serial.println("Noise Detected, Tone Played");
      for(int i = 0; i < 3; i++){
      pitchTone(buzzerPin, 800, 600);
      }
    }
    
 }
 
 void pitchTone(int pin, int frequency, int duration)
 {
  int startTime = millis();
  int period = 1000000/frequency;
  while((millis() - startTime) < duration)
  {
    digitalWrite(pin, HIGH);
    delayMicroseconds(period/4);
    digitalWrite(pin, LOW);
    delayMicroseconds(period/4);
  }
 }
</code></pre>

  Next I experimented with the oscilloscope. I hooked up the positive and negative ends of my buzzer to 
  the hooks and ran my program. The oscilloscope took a bit ofmessing around with to get it working but after 
  a few attempts, I got a sucessful graph.
