  I'd like to start this documentation off by saying that my project for this week had one flaw with it that through extensive amounts 
  of troubleshooting and questions, I could not find a solution. This week i tried to use SPIFFS to create a web interface to 
  change the brightness of the leds from a webpage. I don't have much to document this week but here is my setup.

  These were the parts I used to build the circut. The wiring was very simple and I used an esp32 to upload to a webpage. I got the html, css, and JavaScipt files
  from RandomNerd and followed the tutorial on downloading SPIFFS. Here is the completed wiring.

  Even though this project didn't work it was still fun to do and I liked using wifi and found it intresting. I also did another simpler tutorial 
  that had just one LED and allowed me to turn it off and on from a webpage.

  So unfortunatley thats pretty much all I had for this week but I still found the material interesting and fun.
