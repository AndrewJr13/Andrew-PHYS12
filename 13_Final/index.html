  <head>Final Project Documentation</head>
  <br>
  <center>It has been a great semester for Digital Fabrication and to close it out, here is the Documentation
    for my final project. For my final, I created a gesture and proximity controlled locking system and implemented it 
    onto a small door. I mainly chose this project because I have always been intrested in automation and engineering applications
    to households. Growing up, my Dad would often design and implement home automation systems to turn off lights, adjust temperatures, and 
    control cameras outside the house. I always took intrest in these sort of things and was inspired to learn more. While a gesture lock isn't exactly 
    automation, the proximity lock part comes close. I decided to make the gesture lock after I found out about the sensor and thought it would be a really 
    cool project to do. I instantly reserved the sensor from Microcenter when I found out about it and started working after. My project uses a 16x2 Liquid Crystal 
    display, a 360 degree servo motor, a RBG 4-pin LED, and of course the Adafruit APDS9960 proximity and gesture sensor. So thank you to my classmates and instructors for 
    a great semester and here is my final project.

    <head>Initial Progress: Wiring</head>
    <br>
    <center>To start the project off, I got my initial wiring and coding done. I first wired 
      my LCD display, sensor, and servo to my Arduino. Many connections went through the breadboard 
      and the wires were very messy and tangled which was the motive to make a box to contain them on the final 
      structure.

      <p>Before I knew it, it was time to mount my electronics. Using a very simple 3D design and taking measurements of my components, 
      I had a frame for all of my electronics. The LCD display would take up the main portion of the frame. The sensor was offset and mounted to 
      a small arm coming out from the main frame. My reasoning for this was to give the user room to gesture but also be able to see the output on the 
      LCD display. Below the display, a small hole would be origiinally dedicated to a button that would activate the system, but later I decided that I wanted
      the system to be activated with proximity. So instead of a button, I would fit an LED into the hole.</p>
