  <center>It has been a great semester for Digital Fabrication and to close it out, here is the Documentation
    for my final project. For my final, I created a gesture and proximity controlled locking system and implemented it 
    onto a small door. I mainly chose this project because I have always been intrested in automation and engineering applications
    to households. Growing up, my Dad would often design and implement home automation systems to turn off lights, adjust temperatures, and 
    control cameras outside the house. I always took intrest in these sort of things and was inspired to learn more. While a gesture lock isn't exactly 
    automation, the proximity lock part comes close. I decided to make the gesture lock after I found out about the sensor and thought it would be a really 
    cool project to do. I instantly reserved the sensor from Microcenter when I found out about it and started working after. My project uses a 16x2 Liquid Crystal 
    display, a 360 degree servo motor, a RBG 4-pin LED, and of course the Adafruit APDS9960 proximity and gesture sensor. So thank you to my classmates and instructors for 
    a great semester and here is my final project.
