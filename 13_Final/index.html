  <head>Final Project Documentation</head>
  <br>
  <center>It has been a great semester for Digital Fabrication and to close it out, here is the Documentation
    for my final project. For my final, I created a gesture and proximity controlled locking system and implemented it 
    onto a small door. I mainly chose this project because I have always been intrested in automation and engineering applications
    to households. Growing up, my Dad would often design and implement home automation systems to turn off lights, adjust temperatures, and 
    control cameras outside the house. I always took intrest in these sort of things and was inspired to learn more. While a gesture lock isn't exactly 
    automation, the proximity lock part comes close. I decided to make the gesture lock after I found out about the sensor and thought it would be a really 
    cool project to do. I instantly reserved the sensor from Microcenter when I found out about it and started working after. My project uses a 16x2 Liquid Crystal 
    display, a 360 degree servo motor, a RBG 4-pin LED, and of course the Adafruit APDS9960 proximity and gesture sensor. So thank you to my classmates and instructors for 
    a great semester and here is my final project.

    <head>Initial Progress: Wiring</head>
    <br>
     To start the project off, I got my initial wiring and coding done. I first wired 
      my LCD, sensor, and servo to my Arduino. Many connections went through the breadboard 
      and the wires were very messy and tangled which was the motive to make a box to contain them on the final 
      structure.
      <br> 
      <center>![](./wire12.png)</center>
      <br>
      <body>Before I knew it, it was time to mount my electronics. Using a very simple 3D design and taking measurements of my components, 
      I had a frame for all of my electronics. The LCD would take up the main portion of the frame. The sensor was offset and mounted to 
      a small arm coming out from the main frame. My reasoning for this was to give the user room to gesture but also be able to see the output on the 
      LCD. Below the display, a small hole would be origiinally dedicated to a button that would activate the system, but later I decided that I wanted
      the system to be activated with proximity. So instead of a button, I would fit an LED into the hole.</body>

      Pins soldered onto sensor and glue to structure to minimize messiness of wiring.

      And here is the finished wiring frame.

      <br>
      <head>Next Steps: Coding</head>
      <br>
      First, I started off by initializing my LCD. This was a very simple process. Using the LiquidCrystal constructor,
      I defined my rs, enable, D4, D5, D6, and D7 pins and the display was up and working just like that. 
  <pre><code class="language-arduino">
      LiquidCrystal lcd(8, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7);
  </code></pre>
      The only thing left to do was incorporate an analogWrite on pin 11 to adjust the constast of the display. On the actual LCD board, 
      the pin named V0 is the contrast controller. In my case, I connected V0 to pin 11 on my board. After that the last thing to do was to begin the display!
  <pre><code class="language-arduino">
    analogWrite(11, 140);
    lcd.begin(16, 2);
  </code></pre>
      Next, I decided to code the sensor and lock before I assembled the project. I already had the 
      electronics mounted and running so I started the coding process. First part of coding was getting the sensor the recognize gestures.
      Unfortunatley the Adafruit library that went with the sensor was not able to be used since it collided with the LiquidCrystal library. Even more 
      of a drawback was the fact that the only alternate library (SparkFun_APDS9960) was a bit more complicated. Mainly, the fact that the Adafruit library was able to use 
      if statements for the gestures. For example:
      <br>
  <pre><code class="language-arduino">
    if (DIR_RIGHT)
    {
      //Do this 
    }
  </code></pre>
      <br>
    Unfortunatley the Sparkfun library would not work with if statments. This was mainly due to the readGesture() method.
    This method was very confusing. After further research, I found out that the method returned an integer value. I soon was excited and 
    thought I could incorporate an if statement with the "==" binary operator if each direction returned a different integer. Unfortunatley this was not the case. 
    After further testing, I found the method returned 0 for every direction. Something that still confuses me to this day. So my last resort was to take a peek at the example code for the 
    gesture sensor and found out I would have to use a switch and cases. Switches and cases were something I was familiar with from my Java and Javascript experience but I never 
    really loved them. Unfortunatley it seemed this was the only way. The next step was to incorporate code for an interrupt. First I bound the 
    the interrupt to pin 2 on my Arduino, and set an interrupt flag. I also created my sensor object which i just called "apds."
  <pre><code class="language-arduino">
    #define APDS9960_INT 2
    int isr_flag = 0;
    SparkFun_APDS9960 apds = SparkFun_APDS9960();
    pinMode(APDS9960_INT, INPUT);
  </code></pre>
    Next I used Arduino's "attachInterrupt" method and a method that changes the interrupt flag
    called "interruptRoutine."
      <pre><code class="language-arduino">
    attachInterrupt(0, interruptRoutine, FALLING);
    void interruptRoutine() 
    {
      isr_flag = 1;
    }
  </code></pre>
    Next it was time to create the loop and incorporate the interrupt inside the loop. First, the loop 
    checks if isr_flag = 1 which it should through the interruptRoutine method which sets it to 1. Next, the program 
    detaches the Interrupt and resets isr_flag. I then implemented my main sequence there (I will get to that later), reset isr_flag, and then
    re-attached the interrupt. This sequence of code would mean that everytime I waved my hand in front of the sensor, my loop wold run my 
    gestureSequence() method which I will showcase later. 
  <pre><code class="language-arduino">
    if ( isr_flag == 1 ) {
      detachInterrupt(0);
      lcd.clear();
      gestureSequence();
      isr_flag = 0;
      attachInterrupt(0, interruptRoutine, FALLING);
  </code></pre>
    After creating the interrupt, I started working on the gestureSequence() method. First off was 
    an if statement using a method from the Sparkfun library. Very simple:
  <pre><code class="language-arduino">
    if ( apds.isGestureAvailable() ) {
  </code></pre>
    Next I created my switch. In my case, the switch will keep running the readGesture() method 
    until it matches it to a specific case. In each case, I cleared the LCD, set the cursor so the text would be 
    centered then printed the direction corresponding to the gesture. For example, here is what the 
    DIR_UP case looked like. 
  <pre><code class="language-arduino">
    lcd.clear();
    cd.setCursor(7, 0);
    lcd.print("up");
    delay(500);
    break;
  </code></pre>  
    After this, my next step was to set up my servo and test it with just one gesture. Here's the simple
    setup code using the Servo library.
  <pre><code class="language-arduino">
    const int MTR_PIN = 12;
    Servo lock;
    lock.attach(MTR_PIN);
    lock.write(29); //starts in locked position when code is uploaded
  </code></pre>  
  As I said before, I ran the servo lock with just one gesture. Here the code and a quick video.
  <pre><code class="language-arduino">
    lcd.clear();
      lcd.setCursor(6, 0);
      lcd.print("left");
      lock.write(129);
      delay(500);
      lcd.print("welcome");
      break;
  </code></pre>
  <br>
  <video controls width="1100" height="700">
    <source src="left.mp4"
            type="video/mp4">
  </video>
  Next step was the most time consuming but also the most important. I took some time to brainstorm 
  a way to have a sequence of hand gestures activate the servo and unlock the door. Ultimatley, I decided 
  to use a simple integer array. I started by declaring two arrays. One for the current gesture sequence and 
  the other would be the correct sequence. 
  <pre><code class="language-arduino">
    int current[] = {0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0};
    int correct[] = {1, 3, 4, 3, 2, 4, 3}; //each number is a gesture 1 = up, 2 = down, 3 = left, 4 = right
  </code></pre> 
  Next course of action was having each case set an element of the array to an integer that matches the direction. 
  I defined each number above in the code. So 1 is up, 2 is down, 3 is left, 4 is right. Simple enough. Now im not very familiar
  with C so I originally thought of arrayLists. Whenever I code with Java, I love using arrayLists for things like these. It would be much easier
  to use the add and remove methods inside the cases but unfortunatley it didn't seem that something like this would be 
  possible on C. So I created an integer called "index." Index would increment evertime a gesture was detected and then 
  my code would set that index of the array to an integer based off of the gesture. For example, if index = 0 and the user gestures 
  downward, index 0 of the "current" array will be set to 2 and index will increment so that the next gesture will occupy the next 
  index of the array. So now the DIR_UP case was looking something like this. 
  <pre><code class="language-arduino">
    case DIR_UP:
        lcd.clear();
        lcd.setCursor(7, 0);
        lcd.print("up");
        delay(500);
        current[index] = 1;
        index++;
        count++; //see next section
  </code></pre>  
  So now I had the arrays taken care of. I now needed to compare both arrays. If the arrays matched, the servo would open and if not then 
  it would stay closed. Fortunatley, my prior coding experience came in handy. First I needed a way for the program to know
  when the amount of gestures performed matched the number of elements in the "correct" array so the sensor would not run past that point. So I created 
  a "count" variable. "Count" would increment inside of every case and I ran a quick if statement to check when count was the same as the size of the correct array. 
  Next I created a for loop that would run through both arrays and compare each element inside. If the elements matched, a variable called "numRight" would increment. 
  <pre><code class="language-arduino">
    if (count == sizeof(correct))
    {
      for (int i = 0; i < sizeof(correct); i++)
      {
        if (current[i] == correct[i])
        {
          numRight++;
        }
      }
  </code></pre>  
  After this, it was a simple journey to the end. I ran an if statement that checked if numRight was 
  equal to the size of the correct array. If it is, that means every element of the "current" array matches every element 
  of the "correct" array. After this I cleared the LCD, printed "welcome," and turned the servo. I also added two loops inside this statment. 
  One was simply to control my LED and the other reset the elements of the "current" array. I then set index, count, and numRight back to 0.
  <pre><code class="language-arduino">
    if (numRight == sizeof(correct))
      {
        lcd.clear();
        lock.write(129);
        lcd.print("welcome");
        for (int i = 0; i < 3; i++)
        {
          analogWrite(greenLight, 255);
          delay(100);
          analogWrite(greenLight, 0);
          delay(100);
        }
        delay(1500);
        lcd.clear();
        for (int i = 0; i < sizeof(current); i++)
        {
          current[i] = 0;
        }
        numRight = 0;
        count = 0;
        index = 0;
      }
  </code></pre>   
  After this, I created another if statement for an incorrect sequence. All it does is flash the LED red, print "incorrect,"
  then resets the "current" array and sets index, count, and numRight back to 0.
  <pre><code class="language-arduino">
    if (numRight != 7 && count != 0)
    {
      lcd.clear();
      lcd.print("incorrect");
      analogWrite(redLight, 255);
      delay(2000);
      analogWrite(redLight, 0);
      lcd.clear();
      for (int i = 0; i < 7; i++)
      {
        current[i] = 0;
      }
      numRight = 0;
      count = 0;
      index = 0;
    }

  } //end if (count == sizeof(correct))
  </code></pre>    
  Finally, here is a video of the first sequence I tested. It contained 4 gestures and to my suprise,
  worked the first try.

            type="video/mp4">
  </video>
  <br>
  The last part of my program is the proximity lock. Fortunatley, this too could be done in a case. 
  My DIR_FAR case detected when a user would slowly distance themselves from the sensor and I planned to 
  have it lock the door. First, I reset count, index, and numRight to 0. Then I clear the LCD and print "locking..."
  I then use a loop to flash the LED blue 2 times. Then the servo locks and the "current" array is reset. Thats it!
  <pre><code class="language-arduino">
    count = 0;
        index = 0;
        lcd.clear();
        lcd.print("locking...");
        delay(1000);
        for (int i = 0; i < 2; i++)
        {
          analogWrite(blueLight, 255);
          delay(100);
          analogWrite(blueLight, 0);
          delay(100);
        }
        lock.write(29);
        lcd.clear();
        numRight = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < 7; i++)
        {
          current[i] = 0;
        }
        break;

  <head>Final steps: Assembly</head>
  <br>
  Now that I had finished my code, it was time for part making and assembly. To get started, I designed 
  the 3D prints. Most prints were 4-5 hours so timing was not bad. I started with the frame. It was a simple design. 
  I first started with the frame, and the door itself. The frame was generally easy to model, the only other part being making the 
  slot in the back where the servo lock would mount. And I also glued a couple pieces of wood together so that the servo would sit nicely.

  <br>
  Next it was time to mount the servo and install the door hinge both of which were easy tasks. I mounted the servo to the pieces 
  of wood and glued it down. This part was necessary since the servo motor had two small mounts on it. I tested the servo and found that the lock reached perfectly.

  <br>
  After this, I did the hinge. I used the drill press to drill 2 small pilot holes which I would then secure screws onto later. 
  I lined the hinge up, marked the drilling spots and took it to the drill press. I then mounted the hinge by taking 2 screws that fit the holes and 
  drilled into the 3D print.

  <br>
  Next I made the actual door. Again, this design was very simple but contained a small slot in the middle that the servo would fit into thus locking the door. 
  All it took was a few sketches and I had the door designed. I took it to the 3D printer, waited around four and a half hours and it was done.

  <br>
  Before putting the control module together, at the last minute I decided to sub out my button and use the proximity sensor so that proximity would activate the gesture sensor 
  instead of just pressing a button. So I had an extra slot for something. I grabbed an RGB LED and it fit perfectly. I soldered the connections and ran them under the breadboard glued 
  onto the back of the control module. I wired the connections to resistors on the breadboard then to my red, green, and blue pins and just like that, I had a working LED. The first picture is the wires of 
  the LED under the breadboard and the second is the connections.

  <br>
  I then continued the control module by making the stands it would rest on. I decided on some aluminium since it was strong and looked good. 
  I took measurements, cut out two pieces then used hot glue-which works suprisingly well with aluminium-to mount them on.

  <br>
  I then started on the base. I chose a very thick piece of acrylic that would be long enough for my door and my control module. 
  I did not have to do any cutting which was perfect. I then used a piece of wood to make a base for my door and when put all together, it was starting to look pretty good.

  <br> 
  After this, all was left was the finishing touches. My first action was doing some wire organization. So the poject would look clean, I ran the servo motor 
  wires under the piece of arylic. This was pretty easy. I drilled a hole in the wood base and the acrylic base and ran the servo wires to pins comning from the 
  control module.

  <br>
  After this I routed them under the acrylic and connected them then secured the wires to the acrylic with hot glue.

  <br>
  The next step in organization was to contain the wires on the control module. The control module started out looking like this which was very messy. 
  ![](./mod1.png)
  <br>
  I manufactured a quick wire box to contain the wires and routed my Arduino cable in it so I would be able to take a usb extender and connect it 
  right to the wiring box. The module now looked decent and organized and I was able to connect the system very easily just plugging in a usb extender. This is how it came out.
