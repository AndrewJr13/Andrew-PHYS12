  For week 3, I had a lot of ideas. My initial thought was to make the locking mechanism for my final 
  project but I came to the conclusion that without something like an Arduino to change the direction
  that the motor would turn, the project would be ultimatley useless and overly complicated. My second thought
  was the one that came to life. I decided to make a windmill. This idea formulated very well in my mind so 
  I did not have to use a ton of scetches. I used a digital caliper to make sure I wasn't going to make it too 
  big or too small. Next, I went to fusion 360 and started with the supports of the windmill. I decided to have four 
  main legs on the windmill and some connecting pieces that would go around all of the legs. I went into Fusion and started
  to design. These were my projections for the supports:

  I planned to glue the supports in the first picture together to form the legs. This turned out tobe pretty 
  sucessful. Next, I moved on to the part that would attach to the motor. I decided to take the dimensions 
  of the shaft on the motor and make a square inscribed in a circle. The square would fit right on the shaft 
  and I could attach my propellers to the circle. Now, for the actual attaching of the propellers, I had to do this 
  at home since I was not able to finish it in the lab. I ran into a large roadblock that the glue I was using would
  not bind the circular part to the propellers. So I had to improvise. I actually ended up using rolled up pieces of paper 
  and putting glue on them. I then inserted the paper into the carboard on the propeller and then into the cardboard 
  of the circular part. As for the motor itself, I used a soldering iron to make sure the wires were on well. 
  I was actually decently proud of my solders as it was only my 3rd time ever using a soldering iron. 
  The binds I made held very well and kept good conductivity. I will include a picture of those as well.
  The following pictures are of the circular part, the propellers, the final product of 
  the motor part, and my solders on the motor:
