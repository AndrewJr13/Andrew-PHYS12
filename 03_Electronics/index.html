  <head>Class 2: Cutting and Design</head>
  For week 3, I had a lot of ideas. My initial thought was to make the locking mechanism for my final 
  project but I came to the conclusion that without something like an Arduino to change the direction
  that the motor would turn, the project would be ultimatley useless and overly complicated. My second thought
  was the one that came to life. I decided to make a windmill. This idea formulated very well in my mind so 
  I did not have to use a ton of scetches. I used a digital caliper to make sure I wasn't going to make it too 
  big or too small. Next, I went to fusion 360 and started with the supports of the windmill. I decided to have four 
  main legs on the windmill and some connecting pieces that would go around all of the legs. I went into Fusion and started
  to design. These were my projections for the supports:
