  <head>Class 5: 3D Printing</head>

  I was very excited for this weeks class. I have always been intrested in 3D printing but 
  often didn't know how to start. For this week's class I started by doing a very short 10 minute
  print. I designed a hollowed out cube in Fusion 360 and uploaded it to the Prusa slicer. At first 3D design 
  on Fusion seemed tough. I was very used to doing sketches in a single plane and then extruding them to 
  a specific width. This time I had to do sketches in different planes, join pieces, and make cuts as well. Here's 
  how the cube design came out.

  After the print was finished, the cube had a lot of supports in it. The supports were necessary
  since most of the shape was hollowed out. I was able to use a pair of small pliers to extract the 
  supports. It took a good amount of time and some supports did not come off easily but I was able to 
  complete the shape. After this, I did a more lengthy print. I decided to make a component for my final project. Of course the component
  wouldn't be full size since the full size print would take around 4-5 hours. I made a smaller version that only took about 40 minutes. 
  The door would be 3D because of the small handle on it but I also added something else. My final project will have a locking 
  mechanism on it so I decided to prototype the slot that the locking mechanism would go into. I made a small cut in Fusion 360 and 
  uploaded the design to the slicer. I then waited the 40 minutes for the print to finish and it came out very nicley. Below are the final pictures
  of the door print and my scan as well. I also apoligize for the resolution on the door image. I'm not sure why my phone took that bad of a picture but 
  thats how it came out.
