  <head>Class 5: 3D Printing</head>

  I was very excited for this weeks class. I have always been intrested in 3D printing but 
  often didn't know how to start. For this week's class I started by doing a very short 10 minute
  print. I designed a hollowed out cube in Fusion 360 and uploaded it to the Prusa slicer. At first 3D design 
  on Fusion seemed tough. I was very used to doing sketches in a single plane and then extruding them to 
  a specific width. This time I had to do sketches in different planes, join pieces, and make cuts as well. Here's 
  how the cube design came out and also attached is a full video of the print.
