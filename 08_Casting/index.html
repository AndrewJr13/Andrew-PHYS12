  <head>Class 8: CNC Milling, Molding, and Casting</head> 
  This week's class was about using CNC machines and molding and casting. We started out with a few demos 
  in class on how to run the Shopbot and the wax machine. We then moved on to molding and casting with chocolate, metal, etc. 
  <br>
  <br>
  <head>Shopbot and Aspire</head>
  <br>
  For my assignment I decided to start out with the Shopbot. I wanted to go with trying to cut out a car logo. I found that a 
  Mercedes logo would be simple enough but satisfactory in terms of its looks. While the design for this logo would've been pretty 
  simple, I was able to find a svg image to upload into fusion. I will provide a link for this image at the bottom of the page.
  All it took was a quick save of the image and an upload to fusion and I had the logo designed.

  Next it was time to use Aspire and the shopbot. Aspire proved to be quite complicated at the first look. 
  It was much different than Fusion in the sense that the software mainly used vector graphics to simulate the 
  path that the drill bit would take. This proved to be complicated when making toolpaths for engraving and cutting. 
  I was able to follow the quick tutorial posted on the main website and I was able to get it done. I used the cut toolpath 
  to map out the frame of the logo then used an engrave toolpath to make the actual logo. Within about 20 minutes, I was able 
  to handle the program. I then saved my toolpaths and prepared to cut.

  <br>
  Update 7/18: Shopbot had various problems throughout lab session. I was 4th in line to use it and I didn't end up being able to 
  until there were 15 minutes left in the lab. While I did get the machine to cut my shape, the numbers were off. First, I will either need to make 
  the logo bigger or use a more precise drill bit for thinner engraving. Next, the drill bit only cut through about 3/4ths of the wood leaving
  more cutting to be done to remove the design. Only a few very minor changes are required and within one more cut (on Wednesday's lab) I should have the figure 
  completed. Here are the pictures as of today 7/18.

  <head>Casting and Molding</head>
  <br>
  For my casting part I decided to make a mold of a simple highlighter. As of 7/18, this part is not finished either. My initial molds are sitting as of right now
  but will be quickly finished next lab. For my casting and molding I used a plastic cup, filled it about halfway and stuck the top of my highlighter in it. I used some 
  model magic to help keep the highlihter in place. My plans for next lab session is to make the mold using molten metal. It will be a relativley easy process as all I have to do 
  is heat up some metal and pour it into the mold. The metal will cool within a matter of minutes and I can cut the mold off and take the metal piece out. As of right now, here are the initial 
  pictures of the mold.

  <head>Update as of 7/20</head>
  <br>
  During this lab session I was finally able to get the shopbot up and working. With a few adjustments in Aspire 
  and some quick adjustments to the machine itself, I was ready to try again. This time, I made sure to get an extremely precise reading on the 
  thickness of the wood and then put that number into aspire. Next I adjusted the number of passes that the drill bit would make to 5 instead of 4 to ensure that the 
  bit made it through the entire piece of wood. I also made the actual figure larger to prevent the drill from overlapping the engraving with the border of the shape. 
  Finally, I made the engraving a few millimeters deeper just so it would look a bit better. Finally I took the finished toolpaths to the shopbot and was able to secure 
  a sucess the first try. To finish the piece off, I took it to the belt sander and shaped the sides up to look good.
