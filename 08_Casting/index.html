  <head>Class 8: CNC Milling, Molding, and Casting</head> 
  This week's class was about using CNC machines and molding and casting. We started out with a few demos 
  in class on how to run the Shopbot and the wax machine. We then moved on to molding and casting with chocolate, metal, etc.

  <head>Shopbot and Aspire</head>
  For my assignment I decided to start out with the Shopbot. I wanted to go with trying to cut out a car logo. I found that a 
  Mercedes logo would be simple enough but satisfactory in terms of its looks. While the design for this logo would've been pretty 
  simple, I was able to find a svg image to upload into fusion. I will provide a link for this image at the bottom of the page.
  All it took was a quick save of the image and an upload to fusion and I had the logo designed.
