  <head>Class 4: Microcontroller Programming</head>

  For Class 4, I decided to expand on my project from week 2. My week 3 project wasn't looking like 
  it would be able to do much with this programming but I was inspired to do something with my bridge from 
  week 2. So I decided to create a drawbridge. I had lots of ideas at first. My very first idea was to recreate my 
  first bridge and use a flat piece of cardboard that would be pulled up by a motor to push both sides of the bridge outward. 
  But before this I also had another roadblock. Without 3D printing I had no idea how I was going to make hinges for 
  the bridge parts to fold upwards. I soon discovered living hinges though which are cardboard pieces with very small and 
  precise cuts in them so they act like a real hinge. I watched a quick tutorial on youtube on how to make one and soon 
  had two cut out for the bridge.

  The living hinges were very sucessful as my bridge was able to fold up very easily. I 
  hot glued the hinges directly onto the original parts of my bridge and made a few cuts to ensure 
  everything was snug. After I put the hinges on both sides, I glued the bridge supports down onto a 
  piece of wood just to ensure they would not move when the motor was turned on. I soon ran into a problem though.
  My orignal idea to have this one supporting piece of cardboard that would puch both sides out was not working. The cardboard
  did not distribute its force on the sides of the bridge evenly meaning that most times, one side of the bridge would 
  fold up more than the other. I needed to come up with a quikc fix or new idea for this. I decided to use two motors instead of one and 
  glue a piece of string to each side of the bridge. I would then link both motors to the Arduino board.

  Next I completed the other side of the frame and attached the motor to the other side of the bridge. At this point, the only 
  thing left to do was to hook up the motors to Arduino and program them to raise and lower the bridge. I first declared
  both motors to pins 3, 4, 5, and 6. 

  <pre><code class="language-arduino">
    const int A1A = 3;  // Declaring pins for both motors
  const int A1B = 4;
  const int B1A = 5;
  const int B2A = 6;
  </code></pre>

  After this I had to setup both motors using the pinMode and digitalWrite methods. 

  <pre><code class="language-arduino">
    void setup() {
      pinMode(A1A, OUTPUT);      
      pinMode(A1B, OUTPUT);
      pinMode(B1A, OUTPUT);
      pinMode(B2A, OUTPUT);
      digitalWrite(A1A, LOW);   // start with both the motors off 
      digitalWrite(A1B, LOW);
      digitalWrite(B1A, LOW);
      digitalWrite(B2A, LOW);
    }
  </code></pre>

  
  Now I started the loop method. I'll give a breif explanation of the things going on in this method
  First I power both motors on and have them spin in one direction for 0.55 seconds to raise the 
  bridge. Next, both motors pause for 1 second. After that, the code changes the direction of both motors
  by changing the power provided to each motor. It then runs in the opposite direction for another 0.55 seconds.
  Lastly, both motors stop for three seconds and repeat the loop. 

  <pre><code class="language-arduino">
    void loop() {
      // start the motor 
      digitalWrite(A1A, HIGH);   
      digitalWrite(A1B, LOW);   // Start Both motors in one direction 
      digitalWrite(B1A, HIGH);
      digitalWrite(B2A, LOW);
      delay(550);              // allow the motor to run for 0.55
    
      // stop the motor
      digitalWrite(A1A, LOW);   // Stop Both Motors for 1 secon
      digitalWrite(A1B, LOW);
      digitalWrite(B1A, LOW);
      digitalWrite(B2A, LOW);
      delay(1000);              
     
      digitalWrite(A1A, LOW);  //Switch directions for both motors
      digitalWrite(A1B, HIGH);
      digitalWrite(B1A, LOW);
      digitalWrite(B2A, HIGH);  
      delay(550);              // allow the motor to run for 0.55 seconds
    
      // stop the motor
      digitalWrite(A1A, LOW);   // stop both motors for 3 seconds
      digitalWrite(A1B, LOW);
      digitalWrite(B1A, LOW);
      digitalWrite(B2A, LOW);
      delay(3000);   
    
    }
  </code></pre>  
  The last thing to do was to run the program and text the bridge. Here are the final pictures of the 
  circut and two videos of the bridge working.
