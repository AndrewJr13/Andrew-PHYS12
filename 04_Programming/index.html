  <head>Class 4: Microcontroller Programming</head>

  For Class 4, I decided to expand on my project from week 2. My week 3 project wasn't looking like 
  it would be able to do much with this programming but I was inspired to do something with my bridge from 
  week 2. So I decided to create a drawbridge. I had lots of ideas at first. My very first idea was to recreate my 
  first bridge and use a flat piece of cardboard that would be pulled up by a motor to push both sides of the bridge outward. 
  But before this I also had another roadblock. Without 3D printing I had no idea how I was going to make hinges for 
  the bridge parts to fold upwards. I soon discovered living hinges though which are cardboard pieces with very small and 
  precise cuts in them so they act like a real hinge. I watched a quick tutorial on youtube on how to make one and soon 
  had two cut out for the bridge.
