  <head>Class 4: Microcontroller Programming</head>

  For Class 4, I decided to expand on my project from week 2. My week 3 project wasn't looking like 
  it would be able to do much with this programming but I was inspired to do something with my bridge from 
  week 2. So I decided to create a drawbridge. I had lots of ideas at first. My very first idea was to recreate my 
  first bridge and use a flat piece of cardboard that would be pulled up by a motor to push both sides of the bridge outward. 
  But before this I also had another roadblock. Without 3D printing I had no idea how I was going to make hinges for 
  the bridge parts to fold upwards. I soon discovered living hinges though which are cardboard pieces with very small and 
  precise cuts in them so they act like a real hinge. I watched a quick tutorial on youtube on how to make one and soon 
  had two cut out for the bridge.

  The living hinges were very sucessful as my bridge was able to fold up very easily. I 
  hot glued the hinges directly onto the original parts of my bridge and made a few cuts to ensure 
  everything was snug. After I put the hinges on both sides, I glued the bridge supports down onto a 
  piece of wood just to ensure they would not move when the motor was turned on. I soon ran into a problem though.
  My orignal idea to have this one supporting piece of cardboard that would puch both sides out was not working. The cardboard
  did not distribute its force on the sides of the bridge evenly meaning that most times, one side of the bridge would 
  fold up more than the other. I needed to come up with a quikc fix or new idea for this. I decided to use two motors instead of one and 
  glue a piece of string to each side of the bridge. I would then link both motors to the Arduino board.
